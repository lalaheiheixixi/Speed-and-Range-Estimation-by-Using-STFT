# Speed and Range Estimation bu Using STFT
This project simulates a moving signal source and a fixed sensor that receives this signal and then estimates the speed and range of the moving source. The input parameters are entered by the user in the given range. Ranges of the input parameters(time delay, speed of the moving source, frequency of the signal, etc...) were determined by using Monte Carlo Trials. The sensor gets a modified form of the input signal due to Doppler Effect. By using the STFT and the spectrogram plot of this received signal, the speed and range of the moving source are estimated.
